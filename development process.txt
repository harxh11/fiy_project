1. Create a javascript folder and initialize it with NPM (node package manager)

2. install all dependencies that are required for building and deploying the smart contract.
	-> npm init -y
	-> npm install --save-dev hardhat
	-> npm install ethers
(currently using a testing folder for building and deploying a sample contract)

3. Run Hardhat
	-> "npx hardhat" this creates a complete structure for hardhat itself in our repo.

4. hardhat itself gives multiple options while installing like 
	-> what is the sample structure of project, 
	-> whether to install Git ignore file and other required dependencies
	-> where to initialize the hardhat project root.

5. after this the hardhat will create a complete folder structure for itself which contains folders like contracts, ignition, test, etc. containing sample codes and maybe packages and stuff.

6. now we can just upload our contracts (.sol files) to the contracts folder created by Hardhat
	-> adding the contract that was developed on remix platform (Ballot.sol) and maybe others as well (Storage.sol, Owner.sol)
