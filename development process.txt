==> Create a javascript folder and initialize it with NPM (node package manager) in VS Code..

==> install all dependencies that are required for building and deploying the smart contract.
	-> npm init -y
	-> npm install --save-dev hardhat
	-> npm install ethers
(currently using a testing folder for building and deploying a sample contract)

==> install Solidity extension on VS Code.

==> Run Hardhat
	-> "npx hardhat" this creates a complete structure for hardhat itself in our repo.

==> hardhat itself gives multiple options while installing like 
	-> what is the sample structure of project, 
	-> whether to install Git ignore file and other required dependencies
	-> where to initialize the hardhat project root.

==> after this the hardhat will create a complete folder structure for itself which contains folders like contracts, ignition, test, etc. containing sample codes and maybe packages and stuff.

==> now we can just upload our contracts (.sol files) to the contracts folder created by Hardhat
	-> adding the contract that was developed on remix platform (Ballot.sol) and maybe others as well (Storage.sol, Owner.sol)
